1. Display information in one table:
select * from weapons;
Output ----->
1|Longsword|European two handed sword|1
2|Shortsword|European one handed sword|1
3|Dagger|A small blade for stabbing|1
4|Scimitar|A curved sword developed in Eastern Countries|1
5|Naginata|Japanese spear with a cutting edge|2
6|Javelin|Short spear primarily used for throwing|2
7|Pike|An extremely long spear used by frontline infantry|2
8|Flail|Defined with a metal ball linked to a stick|3
9|Mace|A protruding metal ball attached to a rodk|3

2. Update an item that meets some condition

UPDATE weapons SET description="A protruding metal ball attached to a rod" WHERE name="Mace";
(a perfect time for a typo)

New Output -----> 
9|Mace|A protruding metal ball attached to a rod|3

3. Display the information in both tables using one query
SELECT * FROM weapons, types;
(ugly)

Output--->
It's a huge list of them both...

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

SELECT weapons.name, weapons.description, types.type FROM weapons
   ...> JOIN types ON weapons.type_id = types.id;
(Pretty, this is two lines but is it still considered one query?)

Output ------>
Longsword|European two handed sword|blade
Shortsword|European one handed sword|blade
Dagger|A small blade for stabbing|blade
Scimitar|A curved sword developed in Eastern Countries|blade
Naginata|Japanese spear with a cutting edge|spear
Javelin|Short spear primarily used for throwing|spear
Pike|An extremely long spear used by frontline infantry|spear
Flail|Defined with a metal ball linked to a stick|bludgeon
Mace|A protruding metal ball attached to a rod|bludgeon

5. Delete an item that meets some condition:

DELETE FROM weapons WHERE name="Dagger";
Dagger is no longer visible when SELECT * FROM weapons; is used

Release 3:

There are quite a few types of joins in SQLITE3 Inner Join, Left Outer Join, and Cross Join

An example of a cross join:

SELECT *
   ...> FROM weapons
   ...> CROSS JOIN types;

   It matches each row with the other table's row
   1|Longsword|European two handed sword|1|1|blade
1|Longsword|European two handed sword|1|2|spear
1|Longsword|European two handed sword|1|3|bludgeon
