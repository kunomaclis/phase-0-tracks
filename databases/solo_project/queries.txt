1. Display information in one table:

select * from weapons;

2. Update an item that meets some condition

UPDATE weapons SET description="A protruding metal ball attached to a rod" WHERE name="Mace";
(a perfect time for a typo)

3. Display the information in both tables using one query
SELECT * FROM weapons, types;
(ugly)

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

SELECT weapons.name, weapons.description, types.type FROM weapons
   ...> JOIN types ON weapons.type_id = types.id;
(Pretty, this is two lines but is it still considered one query?)

5. Delete an item that meets some condition:

DELETE FROM weapons WHERE name="Dagger";
