# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a programming concept that allows mulitple users to work on the same project and make non destructive changes to it through merging branches, committing changes, and reviewing changes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of a project's master repository that can be edited without affecting the master repository. We want to use branches to make safe changes to a project while experimenting with potential features for master deployment.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a git function that allows the user to record changes made to any file in a git repository. Good commit messages describe the exact change done in the imperitive mode. No periods allowed! 

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is the result of two or more users changing the same line in the same file, or if one user deleted the file while the other decided to modify it. This will prevent the merge from continuing successfully and will need to be resolved by the user.
