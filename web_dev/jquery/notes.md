# Understanding Jquery
## What I should be looking for
* Go for static documentation from W33 and Jquery website
* Consider quick Youtube videos of Jquery interacting with programs 
* Take at least 5-10 minutes while studying to apply some techniques that look foreign to you 

## Andddddd go! What did I learn?
* Already it seems to be better to load Jquery from Google or Microsoft: https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_get_started.asp
* $ starts Jquery into $(selector).action()

* I love W33.
