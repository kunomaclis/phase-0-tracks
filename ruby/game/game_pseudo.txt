# How this game should work (HangRuby)

- user1 inputs a secret word

- Secret word is INITIALIZED with a guess COUNT equal to the word length

- User2 will need to guess the word. 

- Secret word letters will be broken into an array to allocate for each blank segment of a word broken up by "_" repeated guesses don't count for a guess

- Continual feedback of word being filled in for correct letters. Letters correlate to portions of array

- Guessed word will look to Secret Word array to find same letters. Then replace _ with letters

- If user guesses word without running out of guesses. Game prints "Good job!!!" if not, it prints 'Try again loser."
