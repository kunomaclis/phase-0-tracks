# How this game should work (HangRuby)


- Secret word is INITIALIZED with a guess COUNT equal to the word length

- User will need to guess the word. 

- Secret word letters will be broken into an array to allocate for each blank segment of a word broken up by "_" repeated guesses don't count for a guess

- Continual feedback of word being filled in for correct letters. Letters correlate to portions of array

- If user guesses word without running out of guesses. Game prints "Good job!!!" if not, its prints 'Try again loser."
